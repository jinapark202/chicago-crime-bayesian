### Progress Made

### Group Roles

### Research Question 1

Predicting hotspots of specific crimes and how they changed over time.

Analyzing Hotspots of Crime Using a Bayesian Spatiotemporal Modeling Approach


**Models:**

The probability of an individual being a victim of a violent crime ($p_{ij}$)

### Research Question 2

Examining how crime rates have changed over time and differences in these changes across neighborhoods.

#note that we specify both mu and tau variables
